Difference between props and state

Props:

Immutable (Read-Only):
Props are passed from a parent component to a child component, and they are immutable (read-only) within the child component.
The child component cannot modify the values received through props.


Parent to Child Communication:
Props are used for communication between a parent component and its child components.
Data flows from parent to child components.


Function Parameters:
Props are similar to function parameters. They are passed to a component when it is created and cannot be modified by the component itself.


External Input:
Props are external inputs to a component. They are defined by the parent and provide a way for the parent to influence the child component.

State:


Mutable (Can be Modified):
State is used to represent the internal state of a component, and it is mutable (can be modified) within the component.


Component's Own Data:
State is used for managing and updating data within a component. It represents the current state of the component and can change over time.


Set by Component Itself:
State is set and updated within the component using the useState hook or the this.setState method (for class components).


Local to Component:
State is local to a component and is not directly accessible by other components. It is encapsulated within the component that owns it.
